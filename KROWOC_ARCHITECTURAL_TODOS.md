# Krowoc Architectural TODOs

This document provides a prioritized list of architectural tasks derived from the [KROWOC_ARCHITECTURAL_REFINEMENTS.md](./KROWOC_ARCHITECTURAL_REFINEMENTS.md) recommendations. These items should be incorporated into sprint planning and technical roadmap discussions.

## High Priority (MVP Foundation)

- [ ] **API Contract Setup**
  - [ ] Define GraphQL schema with core types and queries
  - [ ] Generate JSON Schema from GraphQL for validation
  - [ ] Implement Pydantic models matching GraphQL types

- [ ] **Database Foundation**
  - [ ] Create Alembic migration framework and initial schemas
  - [ ] Implement migration CI/CD validation pipeline
  - [ ] Define rollback procedures for failed migrations

- [ ] **Authentication Implementation**
  - [ ] Configure Supabase Auth with PKCE flow
  - [ ] Implement token validation and refresh logic
  - [ ] Add HTTP-only cookie storage with CSRF protection

- [ ] **Development Environment**
  - [ ] Create docker-compose setup for local development
  - [ ] Implement development seed data scripts
  - [ ] Set up hot-reloading for frontend and backend

- [ ] **Core Monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoints with standardized format
  - [ ] Set up basic request logging with correlation IDs
  - [ ] Configure PostHog for frontend and backend error tracking

## Medium Priority (Pre-Production)

- [ ] **Scalability Foundation**
  - [ ] Ensure API endpoints are stateless for horizontal scaling
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling for database access
  - [ ] Create database index strategy for common queries

- [ ] **Caching Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up Redis cache with environment-specific TTLs
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation hooks for data changes
  - [ ] Configure CDN for static assets

- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting at API gateway level
  - [ ] Configure WAF rules for common attack vectors
  - [ ] Document RBAC model for different user tiers

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Implement centralized error logging with structured context
  - [ ] Create error categorization framework
  - [ ] Build error rate dashboards by category

- [ ] **LLM Integration**
  - [ ] Implement adapter pattern for LLM providers
  - [ ] Build circuit breakers with retry logic
  - [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for provider failures

## Lower Priority (Post-MVP)

- [ ] **Advanced Monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement distributed tracing across services
  - [ ] Add custom instrumentation for key workflows
  - [ ] Set up anomaly detection and alerting

- [ ] **Scaling Enhancements**
  - [ ] Plan for database read replicas
  - [ ] Implement separate read/write API paths
  - [ ] Create data partitioning strategy for historical data

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Implement multi-level caching with tailored TTLs
  - [ ] Set up edge caching for global performance
  - [ ] Optimize database query patterns based on usage

- [ ] **Operational Readiness**
  - [ ] Create runbooks for common operational scenarios
  - [ ] Implement automated performance testing in CI/CD
  - [ ] Establish regular security audit process

## Technical Debt Prevention

- [ ] **API Versioning**
  - [ ] Define versioning strategy (URI, header, or content negotiation)
  - [ ] Implement version routing in API gateway
  - [ ] Create documentation for version lifecycle

- [ ] **Feature Flag Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Set up Unleash for feature flag management
  - [ ] Implement frontend and backend flag consistency
  - [ ] Create process for flag lifecycle management

- [ ] **Code Quality Automation**
  - [ ] Configure type checking in CI pipeline
  - [ ] Set up automated testing for critical paths
  - [ ] Implement code complexity metrics with thresholds

This TODO list should be reviewed and updated regularly as part of the development process, with completed items checked off and new items added as architectural requirements evolve.
