# Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current project status and outlines the next steps for development.

## Current Status

The Krowoc project has been initialized with the basic repository structure and essential components:

- **Project Structure**: Set up with frontend, backend, orchestration, and docs directories
- **Backend (Flask)**: Basic Flask application with database models and migration setup
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Initial Next.js application with homepage
- **Orchestration (Prefect)**: Sample workflow for prompt execution
- **Development Environment**: Docker configuration for local development

## Next Steps

### Backend Development

1. **Authentication**
   - [ ] Implement Supabase Auth integration
   - [ ] Set up OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
   - [ ] Configure PKCE flow for auth providers
   - [ ] Implement token validation and refresh logic

2. **API Endpoints**
   - [ ] Create GraphQL schema
   - [ ] Implement user endpoints (registration, profile)
   - [ ] Implement prompt CRUD operations
   - [ ] Implement execution endpoints
   - [ ] Implement API key management

3. **Database**
   - [ ] Create initial migration script
   - [ ] Set up connection pooling
   - [ ] Implement data validation with Pydantic

4. **LLM Integration**
   - [ ] Integrate with aisuite library
   - [ ] Implement streaming responses
   - [ ] Set up retry and error handling

### Frontend Development

1. **Authentication UI**
   - [ ] Create login/signup pages
   - [ ] Implement OAuth flow
   - [ ] Add account management UI

2. **Core Components**
   - [ ] Implement PromptEditorForm component
   - [ ] Create dashboard layout
   - [ ] Add navigation and routing
   - [ ] Implement prompt list/detail views

3. **API Integration**
   - [ ] Set up GraphQL client
   - [ ] Create React Query hooks
   - [ ] Implement error handling
   - [ ] Add loading states

4. **Styling & UI**
   - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS
   - [ ] Create responsive layouts
   - [ ] Implement dark/light mode
   - [ ] Add accessibility features

### Orchestration

1. **Workflow Definition**
   - [ ] Create proper Prefect flows for production
   - [ ] Implement retry and error handling
   - [ ] Add logging and monitoring

2. **Scheduling**
   - [ ] Set up scheduled tasks
   - [ ] Implement leaderboard scoring flows
   - [ ] Add usage analytics processing

### Integration & Testing

1. **Testing**
   - [ ] Set up backend unit tests
   - [ ] Create frontend component tests
   - [ ] Implement API contract tests
   - [ ] Add end-to-end tests

2. **CI/CD**
   - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions
   - [ ] Set up deployment pipelines
   - [ ] Implement linting and code quality checks

## Issues and Blockers

- Frontend TypeScript configuration needs to be properly set up to resolve module imports
- Authentication implementation is a critical path item before many features can be developed

## Development Priorities

1. Set up proper authentication with Supabase
2. Complete the core CRUD operations for prompts
3. Implement LLM integration with aisuite
4. Create essential UI components and views
