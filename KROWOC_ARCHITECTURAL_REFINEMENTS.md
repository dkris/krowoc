# Krowoc Architectural Refinements & Recommendations

This document outlines architectural refinements and recommendations for the Krowoc platform to enhance robustness, maintainability, and scalability while maintaining development velocity.

## 1. Technical Architecture Strengths

- **Unified Data Strategy**: The decision to centralize on Postgres eliminates integration complexity and reduces data synchronization issues.
- **Redis for Ephemeral Tasks**: Choosing Redis over Kafka for messaging is appropriate for the scale; Redis provides sufficient reliability with lower operational overhead.
- **Supabase Auth**: This offers robust OAuth implementation without having to build authentication from scratch.
- **Feature Flag Infrastructure**: Including Unleash from day one enables progressive rollouts and A/B testing capabilities.

## 2. Architectural Refinements

- **API Contract Evolution**: Consider using JSON Schema alongside GraphQL to enable automated validation in both frontend and backend code.
- **Database Migration Strategy**: Add explicit details about how schema migrations will be versioned, tested, and deployed across environments.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The current plan doesn't explicitly address horizontal scaling; define how components will scale under load (particularly the Flask API).
- **Caching Strategy**: Develop a tiered caching strategy with clear TTL policies for different data types:
  - User data: Medium TTL (1-4 hours)
  - Prompt metadata: Longer TTL (12-24 hours)
  - Leaderboard data: Short TTL (5-15 minutes)

## 3. Technical Debt Avoidance

- **Versioned APIs**: Implement API versioning from the beginning to avoid breaking changes during evolution.
- **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic for backend validation and TypeScript interfaces that mirror the backend models.
- **Modular Monolith First**: Start with a well-factored monolith before considering microservices; focus on clean boundaries between modules.

## 4. Specific Recommendations

### 4.1 Authentication Flow Enhancement
- Implement PKCE flow for all OAuth providers
- Add JWK rotation strategy for securing tokens
- Consider implementing OAuth token introspection for sensitive operations

### 4.2 Operational Excellence
- Add health check endpoints with standardized response format
- Implement circuit breakers for external API calls (especially LLM providers)
- Create runbooks for common operational scenarios

### 4.3 Development Experience
- Add docker-compose setup for local development
- Create seed data scripts for development environments
- Implement hot-reloading for both frontend and backend

### 4.4 Performance Considerations
- Add database read replicas plan for scaling read operations
- Implement connection pooling for database access
- Consider edge caching for static assets
- Plan for CDN integration for global performance

### 4.5 Security Enhancements
- Document a complete RBAC model for different user tiers
- Implement rate limiting at the API gateway level
- Add WAF rules for common attack vectors
- Plan for regular security audits and penetration testing

## 5. Integration Strategies

### 5.1 LLM Provider Integration
- Implement adapter pattern for LLM providers to allow easy addition of new providers
- Create fallback mechanisms when primary LLM provider is unavailable
- Build circuit breakers with automatic retry policies for API calls

### 5.2 Redis Usage Patterns
- Use Redis Pub/Sub for lightweight event notifications
- Implement Redis Streams for ordered, multi-consumer event processing
- Leverage Redis for distributed rate limiting implementation
- Consider Redis Cluster for higher availability in production

### 5.3 Data Migration Strategy
- Create versioned database migrations using Alembic
- Implement rollback procedures for failed migrations
- Add database schema validation tests in CI pipeline
- Create data integrity verification tools for post-migration validation

## 6. Scalability Planning

### 6.1 API Layer Scaling
- Design stateless API endpoints that can be horizontally scaled
- Implement token bucket rate limiting algorithm at the API gateway
- Consider separate read/write API paths to optimize for different scaling patterns

### 6.2 Database Scaling
- Plan for read replicas to handle increased query load
- Implement database connection pooling from application layer
- Consider partitioning strategy for historical data (e.g., prompt executions)
- Design efficient index strategy for common query patterns

### 6.3 Caching Strategy
- Implement multi-level caching:
  - Application memory cache: Sub-second TTL for hot data
  - Redis cache: Medium TTL for shared app data
  - CDN: Long TTL for static assets
- Develop a cache invalidation strategy for data changes

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

### 7.1 Application Performance Monitoring
- Implement distributed tracing across services
- Add custom instrumentation for key operations:
  - Prompt execution workflow
  - Authentication flow
  - Database query performance
- Setup alerting for anomalous behavior patterns

### 7.2 User-Centric Monitoring
- Track user-facing performance metrics:
  - Time to first byte on initial page load
  - Prompt execution latency
  - API response times

### 7.3 Error Management
- Implement centralized error logging with structured context
- Create error categorization framework for quick diagnosis
- Build dashboards showing error rates by category
- Setup automatic alerts for error rate spikes
